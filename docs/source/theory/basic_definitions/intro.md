# Definitions for Left Ventricle Metrics

This section aims to provide basic definitions and standard practices 
for the identification of left ventricle features.


## Basic Definitions:

- [**Longitudinal Line**](./geo_references.ipynb): Line formed between Apex and Base reference nodes.
- [**Normal vector**](./geo_references.ipynb): Vector based on longitudinal line as "Apex" to "Base"
  
## Geometry Types:

- [**Ideal**](./types_of_geometries.ipynb): Geometry created based on ellipsiod.
- [**Type A**](./types_of_geometries.ipynb): Geometry created based on patient-specific data with one large opening (no Mitral or Aortic structures).
- [**Type B**](./types_of_geometries.ipynb): Geometry created based on patien-specific data with two openings: Mitral and Aortic valves.
