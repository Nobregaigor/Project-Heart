In our implementation, we are able to identify based on two offsets (ql and qh) expressed as percentages of the lowest and highest node along the Z axis, respectively. Our algorithm iterates over 'n' steps while virtually rotating and re-estimating values for apex and base regions until the longitudinal line formed from apex-base is closely aligned with the Z axis. In addition, the only constraint we impose is that the starting geometry must be fairly aligned along the Z axis."
